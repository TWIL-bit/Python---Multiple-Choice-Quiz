<h1>Learning Python: Building a Multiple Choice Quiz</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I just completed my latest Python project: A fully functional multiple-choice quiz!
<br> </br>
Building this quiz taught me so much more than I expected. From working with loops and conditionals to organizing questions and handling user input, I was able to apply and reinforce key programming concepts in a hands-on way.
<br> </br>
What made this project especially rewarding was seeing how the pieces came together: displaying questions, checking answers, keeping score, and even letting the user play again. Each function I added gave me a deeper understanding of how to structure a Python script and how to make my code cleaner and more efficient.
<br> </br>
As I continue learning Python, projects like this help solidify what Iâ€™ve learned and give me confidence to take on bigger challenges.
